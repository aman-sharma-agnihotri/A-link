# URL Shortner A-link 

 ## URL Shortner using Next.js, React.js, Tailwindcss, MongoDB Atlas, Node.js!

🚀 Just built & deployed my own URL Shortener — A-link! 🌐✨

## 👉 A-link helps you shorten your long URLs in seconds — no signup, no hassle.

**✅ Fast and lightweight**
**✅ Clean & simple UI**
**✅ Custom short URLs**
**✅ Copy-to-clipboard in one click**

## I built this project using:

**🟢 Next.js 14 (App Router)**
**🟢 MongoDB Atlas for storing URLs**
**🟢 TailwindCSS for styling**
**🟢 Hosted on Vercel**

## 🔗 Features:

**Shorten URLs with your own custom alias.**
**No login required — just paste, shorten, and share.**
**Links are stored in MongoDB with duplicate-checking to avoid conflicts.**


## This was a great opportunity to practice:

**Full-stack development with Next.js API routes**
**Working with MongoDB & environment variables**
